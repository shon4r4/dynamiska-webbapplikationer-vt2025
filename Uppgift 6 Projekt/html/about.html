            <h2>About Home Cooking</h2>
            <p>
                Home Cooking is a calm, practical place for anyone who wants to make good food at home. 
                We write recipes the way you cook on a weeknight: short ingredient lists, clear steps, and no special equipment required. 
                Whether you are new in the kitchen or you already enjoy cooking, our aim is to help you get dinner on the table with less stress and more confidence.
                <br><br>
                Every recipe is tested and written in plain language. 
                We include realistic prep and cook times, gentle cues for heat and texture, and simple notes on what to do if something doesn’t look quite right. 
                If a sauce turns too thick, we show you how to fix it. If you are unsure when to lower the heat, we tell you what signs to look for. 
                Cooking should feel approachable, and small details make a big difference.
                <br><br>
                We start with the pantry: pasta, rice, beans, eggs, canned tomatoes, frozen vegetables, and a few fresh basics. 
                From there, we build dishes that are flexible by design, so you can swap ingredients without losing the spirit of the recipe. 
                If you have spinach instead of kale, or beans instead of chicken, you can still make dinner that tastes great. 
                We also keep different needs in mind, with many recipes that are naturally vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free friendly.
                <br><br>
                Our goal is simple: teach just enough technique to make you faster and calmer in the kitchen, while keeping the joy of cooking front and center. 
                Small wins add up — a better way to salt, the moment to add acidity, the final touch that brightens a dish. 
                We believe anyone can learn these habits, and that good food comes from practice, not perfection.

            <h2>Our journey</h2>
            <p>
                Home Cooking began with a simple question: what can I cook with what I already have? 
                A few friends started sharing notes. A quick pasta ideas, one-pan meals, soups that stretch, and desserts that don’t require special tools. 
                Those notes grew into a small collection, and the collection became this site. 
                From the start, the purpose was to reduce decision fatigue and make everyday cooking feel doable, even on busy days.
                <br><br>
                We learned early that clarity beats cleverness. 
                When a step felt vague, we rewrote it. When timing was inconsistent, we cooked the recipe again and adjusted until it made sense. 
                We focused on common stumbling blocks: when to salt, how much heat a pan needs, how to tell if flavors are balanced, and how to use pasta water to bring a sauce together. 
                Each improvement came from cooking the recipes the way people actually cook at home.
                <br><br>
                As more cooks tried the recipes, their feedback shaped the site. We added clearer ingredient notes, more substitution ideas, and extra reminders in key places. 
                We kept the scope practical: ordinary grocery stores, everyday cookware, and steps that respect your time. 
                The result is a growing set of reliable dishes that you can return to again and again — calm instructions, flexible methods, and flavors that satisfy.
                <br><br>
                Today, Home Cooking continues to evolve with new recipes and small refinements that make the experience smoother. 
                The mission stays the same: help you cook with confidence, teach a little along the way, and make home-cooked food feel welcoming to everyone. 
                We’re glad you’re here, and we hope the next meal you cook with us is your easiest one yet.
